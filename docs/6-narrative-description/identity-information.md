## 6.2 Identity information

Positionality and identity information gathered about a creator is placed in a paragraph at the end of the biographical note. Follow the general paragraph construction found below and ensure that you provide where this information was obtained from (e.g. from the creator directly, family members, or presumptions made by the archivists based on records in the fonds or other information sources).

> *The way archival record creators identify themselves and are identified by others is key to understanding the perspectives and content of their records. Mary Queen of Scots identified as a British, heterosexual, white woman as outlined in her own writings.*
> 
> ***OR***
>
> *The way archival record creators identify themselves and are identified by others is key to understanding the perspectives and content of their records. Mary Queen of Scots was socially understood as white. This information is based on an assessment of records made by the archivist.*

When applicable, we use “white” as an ethnic and racial identity to name whiteness, so that it is no longer the presumed default of the people represented in our collections.[^46]
