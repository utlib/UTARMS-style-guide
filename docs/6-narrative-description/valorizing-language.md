## 6.1 Valorizing language

Narrative description provided in fields such as biographical or administrative histories, or scope and content can be especially prone to include valorizing language or interpretive accounts.

Below is a prior example of a UTARMS’ biographical history:

> *Claude Bissell was born on February 10, 1916, one of ten children of George T. Bissell, a lumberman from Meaford, Ontario, and Maggie Editha Bowen. The family later moved to Toronto where he attended Runnymede Collegiate. He was a **very shy but brilliant student**, with an Edward Blake Scholarship in English and History. In 1932 he entered University College at the University of Toronto where he maintained first-class standing throughout his undergraduate years; the several scholarships he received saw him through financially. He entered graduate school in 1936 as a Reuben Wells Leonard fellow, receiving the following year an MA in English for his study of the satire of Samuel Butler.*
>
> *While at the U of T, he found time for **an impressive** array of extra-curricular activities. He was a member of the Foreign Affairs Club; headed the Forum Club and the Parliamentary Club in third year, and the English and History Club in fourth year. In the latter year he was also vice-president of the Historical Club and editor of the Undergraduate. His active participation in athletics was reserved for the University College lacrosse team.*

In current practice, the first paragraph of the biographical history field should include: full names, life dates or operational dates for organizations, departments, or groups, and a characterization of the individuals’ occupations, significant contributions, and ties to the U of T.

> ***Claude Thomas Bissell (10 June 1916 – 21 June 2000) was an academic and UofT’s eighth President (1958-1971), who also served as the president of Carleton University (1956-1958). In addition to his work as an administrator, he taught as an assistant professor at UofT’s Department of English and authored multiple books.***
