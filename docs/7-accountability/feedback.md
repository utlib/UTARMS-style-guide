## 7.2 Feedback

UTARMS aims to encourage researchers, the general public, our colleagues, those described, or the descendants and community members of those described to let us know when changes to our descriptions are necessary. This can include when we have misidentified individuals or groups, the accuracy of information provided, or impacts on outside individuals or groups. Public methods for this are included through our [feedback form](https://utarms.library.utoronto.ca/feedback) which is linked to in *Discover Archives* and our language statement. Archivists are responsible for exploring and responding to this feedback whether the inclusion of new terminology is integrated or not, with the process and decisions documented in the case file.
