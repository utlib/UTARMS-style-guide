## 7.3 Tracking revisions made to descriptions and finding aids

Revisions made to descriptions should be tracked in the Description Control Area in the *<u>Dates of creation revision deletion</u>* field of Discover Archives, **at the level where the revisions are being made:**

* Explain the change being made, where it is being made, by whom, and when:

> **Example:**[^47]
> 
> *Edits made to scope and content text for accuracy and to incorporate person-first terminology, Daniela Ansovini, May 2022*

* ***Use the phrase “Edits made...”** to facilitate retrieval of edited fields at a later date.

* Use [Markdown](https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/docs/latest/user-manual/add-edit-content/formatting/) to create bulleted list if there are multiple entries in the field

* Also add information guiding researchers to the availability of previous versions of archival description:
  * *Previous versions of this archival description are available upon request by contacting UTARMS*

> EXCEPTION
> 
> If substantial edits are made to a fonds (\~more than 5), include a general note at the fonds-level as well:
>
> *Edits made to the finding aid text (Series 1, 2, and 5) to incorporate person-first terminology, Daniela Ansovini, 2022*
>
> *Previous versions of this archival description are available upon request by contacting UTARMS*

Revisions made in *Discover Archives* should be mirrored in the attached finding aid and Reading Room physical finding aids.

* Add a field to the appropriate level of description titled **Finding aid revisions** (see finding aid template)

* If can be easily summarized include locations of changes in addition to nature of the changes:

  * *Edits made to scope and content for accuracy and to incorporate person-first terminology related to both gender and immigration status, Daniela Ansovini, 2022*
