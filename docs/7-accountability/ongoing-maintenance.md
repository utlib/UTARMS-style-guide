The UTARMS Style Guide will be reviewed and updated every five years to ensure current terminology is incorporated. Changes based on [feedback](https://utarms.library.utoronto.ca/feedback) or shifts in terminology used by a community may be made at any point. The review schedule is intended to confirm the document is regularly maintained and remains up-to-date.
