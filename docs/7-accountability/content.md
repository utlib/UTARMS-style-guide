## 7.4.2 When the content of a record is offensive

Add a content warning when material includes disturbing or highly offensive content that would be difficult for researchers to engage with, particularly when it would not be known until an item is viewed. For example, descriptions of abuse, graphic and violent imagery, or racist, misogynist, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist terms or content. Given the subjective nature of this type of evaluation, archivists are encouraged to discuss with other staff, consult and/or research terms or content they are unsure of. The content warning should be as specific as possible naming the type of discrimination included as well where it is found, when possible.

* **Use the phrase “CONTENT WARNING”** to facilitate retrieval at a later date.

* In *DiscoverArchives*, the content warning should be included in the Note field, at the appropriate level of description.

  * If only specific files require warnings, then include a warning at the file-level

  * If aggregations of records require warnings, then include a warning at the fonds and/or series-level

* In the Finding Aid, the content warning should be recorded as a footnote.
