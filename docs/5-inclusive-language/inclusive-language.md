# 5. Inclusive language 

The following section outlines considerations and suggestions when describing particular aspects of identity. Some common recommendations include:

* Apply the language and terminology used by the subject or community. In the absence of this information, investigate terms used by community members or opt for person-first language.[^15]

* Do not make assumptions about how the subject or community self-identify.

* Be as specific as possible while recognizing the fluidity of both terminology and identity over time. An individual’s sexuality or gender identity can shift over a lifetime, or their chosen terminology may adapt with the varying cultural understandings, acceptability of terms, or identities. Descriptive review and revision are recognized as a continuing component of archival work.

* Do not use adjectives as nouns.

* Consider who is using the term and the context of the term’s use. Is terminology being reclaimed by the individual or affected community? Ensure that this use of terminology is prioritized.
    
  * Note that terms included in the *Instead of...* categories in the tables below should be selected if used by the individual they are describing.

* When necessary, be transparent about presumptions made by using phrases such as "more than likely, given… " or “appears to be based on…” It is critical to provide reasoning for any presumption made (see [section 5.5](/UTARMS-style-guide/5-inclusive-language/migration-and-geographic-terms) for example)
