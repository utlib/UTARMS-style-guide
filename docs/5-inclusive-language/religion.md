## 5.8 Religion

The ways in which an individual’s religious or spiritual belief are written about can unintentionally express bias and forefront dominant value systems. Faith carries both cultural meaning and is highly personal in how it is practiced. Individuals can adhere to formal structures and principles, adopt or decline specific aspects of a practice, interpret these aspects differently, or identify with cultural facets alone.

As with other components of identity, archivists should follow direct guidance from the creator on whether to include this information and the terminology to use. When this is unavailable, religious information should only be included when relevant to understanding the records and the text should cite where this information was obtained from. Do not make assumptions about religion based on ethnicity, name, or appearance[^45]. Research terms for correct use and style proper nouns in the community-held convention, this includes religious texts, deities, holidays, and titles. Ensure descriptions of belief are written in a respectful tone. Do not portray an adherent of a faith as a threat or stereotype. Be as specific as possible regarding denominations, sects, branches, etc. When using terms such as *antisemitism* or *Islamophobia*, archivists should reflect how these terms are understood and used within the records or by the individual / group they are describing. Archivists should also be sensitive to divergent or conflicting definitions of these terms within these communities. Below are suggestions for specific terms and some examples of problematic phrases:

| **Instead of…**                                                        | **Consider…**                                                                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Extremist, fundamentalist, radical                                     | Use caution, ensure accuracy in definition and avoid characterization of faith as a whole |
| Muslim country, Buddhist country                                       | Muslim-majority country, Buddhist-majority country                                        |
| Example: *“Based on superstition, he did not seek medical attention.”* | *“He chose not to accept medical attention based on his faith as a Christian Scientist.”* |
