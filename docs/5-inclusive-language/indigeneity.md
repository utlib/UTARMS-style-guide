## 5.4 Indigeneity

Ensuring the accuracy and appropriateness of description across cultural difference is a priority within UTARMS’ approach. As a colonial institution with a workforce predominately made up of settlers, we carry a pronounced responsibility to understand how Indigenous histories are bound to our own and to centre Indigenous experience in the archives.

To provide recommendations and guidance for UTARMS, we have consulted resources focused on Indigenous individuals and groups living on Turtle Island[^28]. While some of the recommendations are broad and could be applied to all groups and users, we want to recognize that this isn’t intended to represent all Indigenous communities globally. These recommendations apply both to records received from Indigenous individuals and communities, as well as content that documents Indigenous individuals and communities.
