## 5.7 Socioeconomic inclusion

Socioeconomic status is a complex grouping of factors that indicate social status. While centred on wealth, education, and occupation, it also intersects with racial, cultural, gender, sexuality, and geographical/physical factors.[^44] Terminology used to describe class and more broadly, this type of status, often conveys societal perceptions of an individual’s worth. Archivists should be cautious to avoid phrasing that diminishes the agency of individuals or denies existing systemic barriers (e.g. idea of pulling oneself by their bootstraps). Include socioeconomic information only when relevant to understanding the records. Some examples of common terms that carry stigma follow:

| **Instead of…**                                                                 | **Consider…**                                                                             |

| _Marginalized_                                                                  | _systematically marginalized_                                                             |
| _Oppressed_                                                                     | _systematically oppressed_                                                                |
