### 5.4.4 Syllabics

* Identify and use culturally appropriate orthographies and, where possible, include [*<span class="underline">Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics</span>*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Aboriginal_syllabics).  

* Pay close attention to detail to make sure the correct syllabics are used when adding descriptions to *Discover Archives* (e.g. make sure spreadsheets use UTF-8 encoding) and writing the finding aid.
