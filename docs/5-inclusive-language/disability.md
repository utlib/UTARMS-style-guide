## 5.3 Disability

Terminology used to describe disability can be a source of oppression or alternatively, be adopted as a method to undermine ableist norms. For example, denoting the [distinction between a medical model of disability and a social one](https://pwd.org.au/resources/models-of-disability/) can surface through the use and construction of language. Similarly, language can express how a disability may or may not engage with identity or risk overmedicalizing an individual or group. Terminology used is highly personal and not necessarily uniform between, or within, disability communities themselves.

Archivists should first ensure that providing information about disability is both relevant and done with consent. They should consult with the individual themselves, records created from their perspective, or, finally, biological or chosen family members to determine the terms the donor/subject use(d) to describe themselves. Terminology outlined by an individual may not necessarily be a term that is currently accepted. If so, contextual information can be added in square brackets to make this self-identification clear and to add alternative search terms if necessary.

If the subject’s self-identification is unknown, defer to person-first language. Note that while person-first language is the most broadly accepted convention (e.g. student with an intellectual disability), some individuals and communities use identity-first terms that also encompass cultural and experiential meaning. Deaf, autistic, and blind communities generally adopt identity-first language (e.g. autistic individual). Generally, adopt phrasing that follows the social model of disability: recognize the distinction between a disability and the broader conditions that create a disability. Do not use euphemisms, adjectives, or assign value to a disability (e.g. as either inspirational or as a problem). Do not overgeneralize when describing experiences of disability; default to terminology that is as specific as possible. Confirm respectful and non-stigmatizing terminology currently used in regard to a disability, condition, or identity by looking for language identified by an organization that is community-led[^26], or use [a general source](https://www.ungeneva.org/sites/default/files/2021-01/Disability-Inclusive-Language-Guidelines.pdf) as a starting point.

Outside of describing individuals with disability, archivists should be conscious of and avoid phrases that use disability as a metaphor. While often colloquial, this type of use is also often pejorative and can reinforce negative stereotypes. Archivists should select terms that directly describe what is trying to be expressed and opt for additional detail if helpful. Some examples follow:

| **Instead of…**                                                          | **Consider…**                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *insane, crazy, nuts, lunatic, psychotic*                                | *unusual, impractical, impulsive, nonsensical, misunderstood* |
| *invalided from the military*                                            | *received a medical discharge*                                |
| *blind to the situation*                                                 | *unaware of the situation*                                    |
| *was in crippling pain*                                                  | *was in severe pain*                                          |
| *committed suicide* \[not a metaphor, but implies an offense committed\] | *died by suicide*                                             |

### Endnotes

[^26]: Be cautious of organizations that are run by individuals who do not have disabilities (sometimes charitable or advocacy organizations). Favour those that are community-led. For example: [https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/](https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/)

[^27]: Consider whether the individual is part of a community that adopts identity-first language, such as those in the Deaf, Autistic, blind or psychiatric survivor communities.
