## 5.5 Migration and geographic terms

Language and terminology used to describe migration, the geographical movement of individuals or communities, can reflect xenophobic attitudes. Archivists should select terms and phrases that are specific, appropriate in terms of privacy, and that also avoid stigma. In line with the general rule, include immigration information with an appropriate level of detail and only when relevant to the records or biographical history. For example, consider the difference between indicating that an individual moved from a particular place vs. their immigration status itself. Select person-first terminology and avoid use in a way that portrays experience as an immigrant as a totalizing identity.

Be aware of and avoid Eurocentric bias when describing cultures and places. Adopt contemporary proper nouns for places and/ or nationalities ([see section 8.6](/UTARMS-style-guide/8-mechanics/mechanics.md)).[^37] Some examples follow:

When referencing contested geographic regions or occupied states, archivists invariably express their political beliefs through description. The concept of maintaining neutrality in description does not necessarily fulfill desired equity outcomes. Take care to use as specific a term as possible with an awareness of how inclusion or exclusion of a term may express bias or impact a researcher’s ability to surface records. Consider how international bodies, such as the UN, recognize a state, while also keeping in mind the power dynamics at play within this type of institutionalized recognition. Note the region’s disputed status and ensure there is reference to how it is referred to within the records.
