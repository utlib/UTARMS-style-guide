## 8.1 Titling of fonds

Titling of fonds should accurately reflect provenance. Historically, some fonds were titled under one individualâ€™s name, underrepresenting whose records might be included, or who contributed significantly to the creation of those records. Most often this favours men over women or obscures the activity of multiple family members. While what constitutes a substantive contribution will differ broadly between groupings of material, creators should be accurately reflected and considered outside of who was recognized for the work, who was most prominent, or was the subject of the work itself.
