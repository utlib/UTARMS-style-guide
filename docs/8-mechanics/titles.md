## 8.3 Creator-supplied titles vs. archivist-devised titles

UTARMS privileges creator-generated file titles and strives to preserve these when accurate and meaningful in representing content or context.

A devised title is one provided by the staff member writing the description. Titles should be devised when there is no formal title for the materials, or potentially when the formal title is misleading or inadequate.

Devised titles, or archivist-supplied additional words, should be written in square brackets \[ \]

> Records in this fonds have been described using archivist-devised titles as no discernible file titles were present.
