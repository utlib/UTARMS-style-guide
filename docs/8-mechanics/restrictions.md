## 8.7 Restrictions

As of 2024, archivists are encouraged to include the following components within restriction notes:

* Nature of the restriction (e.g. to protect third-party privacy, includes student information, restricted at the request of the donor)

* If a set term restriction is being applied, the calculated end date (e.g. “The following records are restricted until 2035” vs. “The following records are closed for 10 years”)

* Direction for researcher questions (e.g. “Please contact the University Archivist for additional information”).
