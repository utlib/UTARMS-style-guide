## 8.2 Describing arrangement

When available and meaningful we preserve the original order in which we received records, whether chronological, alphabetical order or otherwise. Record this information in the <u>System of arrangement</u> field at the fonds or series-level, as appropriate:

* Arrangement as received from donor.

* Alphabetical, as received from donor

* Chronological, as received from donor

Sometimes there is no discernible arrangement. If the archivist has had a hand in imposing an arrangement, be sure to note this at the appropriate level (fonds or series) in the <u>System of arrangement</u> field:

> *Records from B2019-0019 were given an imposed order as no consistent original order could be identified*.
