## 4.2 Tools for how to describe people and actions

**Focus on impact and avoid evaluative descriptors of donors, subjects, or their work.**[^12]

Describe the subject’s work and the results of the work as opposed to using interpretive language or value judgements, either valorizing or disparaging. Consider quoting from or citing biographical sources to convey impact or significance or listing honors / awards to demonstrate recognition.

| **Instead of…**                                                  | **Consider writing…**                                                                                                                                       |

| *She is recognized as one of the pioneers of the pulsed lasers.* | *She received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2018, together with Gérard Mourou, for their work on pulsed lasers, specifically, chirped pulse amplification.* |
| *Gordon was a preeminent composer of her time.*                  | *Gordon was recognized by her contemporaries as having tremendous influence on the music of the period.*                                                    |
| *Horvath achieved success despite her disability.*               | *Horvath’s accomplishments were numerous.*                                                                                                                  |

> Is this information aiding researchers, or does it reinforce power and privilege to justify the acquisition of the material or the prestige of an individual?[^13]

**Use repetition strategically.** The shift from physical finding aids to online databases has further emphasized the degree to which researchers navigate description in ways that are non-linear or view lower-level description that is detached from the hierarchy. While RAD recommends not repeating information between levels of description, UTARMS is strategic in considering if there is information that would be valuable to repeat given diverse routes of discovery.

{: .note-title }
> Consider
>
> * Will the researcher have enough context to reasonably understand descriptive content if it is not explained? For example, would an acronym be easily understood in context or should the full name be repeated?
>    
>   * Consider how the public-facing database is structured and the potential impacts of a migration to a new system in the future. Is there a chance that a file-level description could become detached from higher levels of descriptions (series, fonds)? This has implications on the choice to use acronyms and abbreviations or write out the full name.
>
> * If repeating information, are there drawbacks in doing so? Try to balance repeated information while sticking to what is necessary. Avoid cluttering the description itself or search results.
> * If it is a substantial amount of information that is necessary, are there other ways that this could be provided? For example, use a link and ‘Please see fonds-level description for additional information’ or an alternative format.

**Identify and describe those who are the subjects of records.** When individuals or groups are the focus of research, policy, or commentary, ensure that the description correctly identifies subjects and that consultation is undertaken with individuals / communities if records are substantial, sensitive, and/or additional perspectives should be incorporated. Ensure documentation of any consultation is included in Description Control: Sources (AtoM) and Notes field (PDF) or case files, as appropriate.

**Describe relationships of power and use active voice to embed responsibility within the description.** Descriptions should acknowledge the types of power relationships present in the records or context of their creation. Use precise phrasing to describe the actions of individuals or effects of systems when oppression is a component of the records and context for their understanding.

| *Protesters lost the fight for improved health services on campus.*                                                     | *The Office of the President denied requests for students to present their case for improved health services on campus.*                       |
| *Artifacts and records were removed from the area and were maintained by Prof. Peters for the remainder of his career.* | *Peters removed artifacts and records from the site and retained them as part of his personal research collection.*                            |

**Whenever possible ask for and use terms identified by the individual / specific communities.** If unable to find this information, research terms used by the individual / community being described or defer to person-first language. Additional information on identity is provided in [Section 5.](/UTARMS-style-guide/5-inclusive-language/inclusive-language)

**Focus on the humanity or personhood of an individual before their identity/ies.**[^14] Consider how your phrasing depicts an individual and reflects their agency.

**Be clear about when you are re-using or referencing description that is sourced from the materials, and when you have used or consulted external sources that give additional details, context, or information.** Cite your sources and indicate if portions of your description have been provided by someone outside of the department, university, or from a particular community or community member.
    
* For example, if you have transformed an organization’s supplied box list into a finding aid without reviewing or editing the titles of the files, say so in a processing note.
    
* For example, if you are using a donor’s website to write a biographical note, cite it.
